    <p style="text-align: right;">I am a grade 10 student at William Lyon Mackenzie CI and I am passionate about computer science and aerospace engineering. As a programmer, I compete in competitive programming contests such as the CCC and the Lockheed Martin Code Quest competition. I also work on some side projects, including web development with Python-Flask, and data analysis with Plotly and Pandas (you can see an example of my graphs <a href="projects/la-foire-des-sciences.html#la-represantation">here</a>). Recently, I have started working on hardware projects involving microcontrollers like Raspberry Pi and ESP32's (you can see an example of one of my projects <a href="projects/game-cube.html">here</a>).</p>

    <p>The competition for which I prepared this year was the Lockheed Martin code quest programming competition. Code Quest is a team programming competition, with groups being up to three people. However, there is a limit of only one computer per team. This made this contest very interesting as it changed the dynamic of solving problems. The questions themselves were simpler than the ones found on competitive programming competitions such as the CCC, but there were many more of them (around 30). After having practiced with my team for the better part of a year, we competed in Texas and we won 1st place in the novice category.</p>

    <p style="text-align: right">One of my main sports is swimming, and I train in a swim club. I plan to swim a sub 26 second 50 free by the end of the year (my current best time is 27.7). I swim year round. Another sport I do a lot of is cycling, which I train alone. I maintain a weekly mileage of around 150km. In the winter, when I could not bike, I ran instead. I plan to compete in a triathlon because I am proficient in two of the disciplines required. In the winter I regularly do cross country skiing. In the summer, I go car camping, backpacking and canoe camping.</p>
